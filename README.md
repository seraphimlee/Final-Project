# Final-Project
Final project for IMT 549

As I am an avid fan of K-pop, I decided to create a site dedicated to my favorite group: ATEEZ. They are an 8-member group from KQ Entertainment and debuted October 2018. As a Korean-American, I grew up listening and watching a lot of Korean media while growing up, and I'm pleased to see how our culture is slowly growing and gaining more recognition around the world thanks to phenomena like the singers PSY, BTS, and the movie Parasite (2019). As their fan, I wanted to get a little creative with showing my appreciation for their music.
